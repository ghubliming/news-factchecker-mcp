## Available Tools

### `fact_check_headline`

Verifies news headlines using AI analysis and web search.

**Parameters:**
- `headline` (string): The news headline to fact-check

**Returns:**
- Verdict (TRUE/FALSE/PARTIALLY_TRUE/UNVERIFIED/MISLEADING)
- Confidence score
- Truthfulness percentage
- Supporting and contradicting evidence
- Recommendations

## üìä Scoring Methodology & Calculation

### How Scores Are Calculated

The fact-checker uses a sophisticated AI-powered scoring system with two main metrics:

#### 1. **Truthfulness Percentage (0-100%)**
This is the primary accuracy score calculated by Google Gemini AI based on:

- **Factual Accuracy**: How well the headline matches verified information
- **Source Reliability**: Quality and credibility of supporting sources
- **Context Completeness**: Whether the headline provides full context
- **Misleading Elements**: Presence of deceptive or incomplete information

**Scoring Ranges:**
- **85-100%**: ‚úÖ HIGHLY ACCURATE - Well-supported by evidence
- **70-84%**: ‚úÖ MOSTLY ACCURATE - Minor inaccuracies or missing context  
- **50-69%**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY ACCURATE - Mixed truth with significant concerns
- **30-49%**: ‚ùå QUESTIONABLE - More false than true elements
- **0-29%**: ‚ùå INACCURATE - Predominantly false or misleading

#### 2. **AI Confidence Level (0-100%)**
This measures the AI's certainty in its analysis based on:

- **Evidence Quality**: Strength and relevance of found sources
- **Source Diversity**: Number and variety of supporting sources
- **Information Consistency**: Agreement between different sources
- **Analysis Completeness**: Whether sufficient data was available

**Confidence Ranges:**
- **90-100%**: Very confident in analysis
- **70-89%**: Confident with good evidence
- **50-69%**: Moderate confidence, some uncertainty
- **30-49%**: Low confidence, limited evidence  
- **0-29%**: Very uncertain, insufficient data

### Verdict Classification System

The system uses 5 distinct verdict categories with specific percentage ranges:

| Verdict | Truthfulness Range | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **TRUE** | 85-100% | Factually accurate and well-supported |
| **FALSE** | 0-15% | Contains significant factual errors |
| **PARTIALLY_TRUE** | 40-75% | Mixed accuracy with some false elements |
| **UNVERIFIED** | 30-60% | Cannot be confirmed with available evidence |
| **MISLEADING** | 20-50% | Technically true but presented deceptively |

### Evidence Analysis Process

The AI analyzes each source for:

1. **Support Status**: Whether the source supports or contradicts the headline
2. **Relevance Level**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW relevance to the claim
3. **Source Credibility**: Reputation and reliability of the source
4. **Content Summary**: Key points from the source relevant to verification

### Factors Affecting Scores

**Positive Factors:**
- Multiple credible sources supporting the claim
- Recent and authoritative information
- Clear, unambiguous language in the headline
- Proper context and attribution

**Negative Factors:**
- Contradictory evidence from reliable sources
- Outdated or unreliable information
- Misleading or sensationalist language
- Lack of proper context or attribution
- Single-source claims without verification

### Example Score Calculation

For a headline like "NASA announces discovery of water on Mars":

1. **Web Search**: Finds 4 credible sources (NASA.gov, Science Journal, National Geographic, Space.com)
2. **AI Analysis**: All sources support the claim with high relevance
3. **Score Calculation**:
   - Truthfulness: 85% (well-supported by multiple authoritative sources)
   - Confidence: 92% (strong evidence from diverse, credible sources)
   - Verdict: TRUE (85% falls in TRUE range)

### `get_trending_topics`

Retrieves current trending news topics.

**Parameters:**
- `location` (string, optional): "international", "local", or "india" (default: "international")

**Returns:**
- List of trending topics with titles, sources, and URLs

## üîÑ Detailed Workflow & How It Works

### Example `mcpServers.json` entry

You can configure this Python MCP server in your `mcp.servers.json` just like a Node.js MCP server. Here are two equivalent ways:

**1. Using the script path:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "news-factcheck": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/your/workspace/src/factcheck/news_factcheck.py"],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Using the module form (recommended):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "news-factcheck": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "factcheck.news_factcheck"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "",
        "NEWS_API_KEY": "",
        "PYTHONPATH": "news-factchecker-mcp/src"
      },
      "url": null,
      "headers": null
    }
  }
}
```

- Use the **script path** if you want to run the file directly (replace with your actual absolute path).
- Use the **module form** if your Python environment is set up with the project root in `PYTHONPATH` (recommended for most setups).
- Add any other required environment variables as needed.

The server includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing API keys
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid input validation
- Service unavailability

## Limitations
